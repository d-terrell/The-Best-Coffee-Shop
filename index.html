<h2> Individual Drinks</h2>
<p> In addition, there will be a drink specific subcategory in
    which I rate individual beverages on a 1 to 5 scale 
    and directly compare same drinks across different coffee shops.</p>

<p> For each individual beverage, I will record the price, size in ounces, and then calculate the price per ounce.
